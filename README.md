# EXGAN
This is the official implementation of "Generating Counterfactual Instances for Explainable Class-Imbalance Learning". We only upload the code for training model on image data (i.e., imbalanced MNIST).
The code for training on conventional data will be uploaded once our paper has been accepted.
